The objective of this project was the construction of an ontology to model certain aspects related to libraries. Two dimensions of the problem are focused on: the representation of information about stored documents and the representation of requests for these documents. This work has been modeled in OWL.

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a standard designed for defining and implementing ontologies on the World Wide Web. In an OWL ontology, it is possible to specify classes, their properties, and the relationships between them. OWL is designed to be used by applications that need to process information rather than just present it to humans. Its structure facilitates machine interpretation by providing additional vocabulary with formal semantics. OWL is currently a W3C recommendation, meaning it is a widely accepted industry standard.
